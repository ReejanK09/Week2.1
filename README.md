Give a short one paragraph description of VirtualBox and OpenWRT. That is, describe them so a new IT student could understand what they are.
VirtualBox 
It is a free and open-source software that lets you run multiple operating systems on a single computer. It works by creating something called a virtual machine, which acts like a separate computer inside your real one. This means you can install and use different operating systems—like Windows, Linux, or even older versions of macOS—without having to wipe your current system or buy extra hardware.
OpenWRT
OpenWRT is a free and open-source operating system designed for routers and other small devices. It replaces the basic software (called firmware) that usually comes pre-installed on home routers, giving you much more control over how your network works.

Use your favourite AI chatbot, e.g., ChatGPT, to create a short description of VirtualBox and OpenWRT. Include the AI description, as well as the prompt, under yours and compare. Comment on the differences.
VirtualBox
VirtualBox is a powerful, open-source virtualization software developed by Oracle. It allows you to run multiple operating systems on a single physical machine by creating virtual environments, called virtual machines (VMs). For example, you can run Linux on a Windows PC, or test different versions of an OS without affecting your main system.
It supports a wide range of guest operating systems including Windows, Linux, macOS (with some restrictions), and others. VirtualBox is widely used by developers, system administrators, testers, and hobbyists to create isolated environments for development, testing, or learning. It's available for major platforms like Windows, macOS, Linux, and Solaris.

OpenWRT
OpenWRT is an open-source, Linux-based operating system designed primarily for routers and other embedded devices. It replaces the stock firmware that comes with most consumer routers, offering advanced features, better performance, and more security.
Unlike typical router firmware, OpenWRT is fully customizable and includes a package manager (opkg) that lets users install thousands of software packages. This makes it possible to add features like VPN servers, ad-blocking, network monitoring, advanced firewall rules, or even mesh networking.
OpenWRT is ideal for tech enthusiasts, network professionals, and anyone who wants more control over their home or small business network. It has a web interface (LuCI) for easy management, as well as full command-line access for advanced users.
